 Calorie Prediction Model Using AI/ML

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a calorie prediction model using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). This system aims to predict the calorie intake or expenditure based on user input data such as meal ingredients, physical activity levels, and other relevant factors. The model will help users make informed dietary and fitness decisions.

### 1.2 Scope
The Calorie Prediction Model will:
- Accept user inputs such as food items, quantities, and physical activity details.
- Predict calorie intake or burn using AI/ML models.
- Provide insights into daily calorie balance.
- Integrate with mobile and web applications for user accessibility.
- Offer visual analytics like charts and graphs for better understanding.

- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
- **ML**: Machine Learning
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **UI**: User Interface
- **Dataset**: A collection of structured data used for training the ML model.
